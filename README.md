# geckodriver

Proxy for using W3C [WebDriver] compatible clients to interact with
Gecko-based browsers.

This program provides the HTTP API described by the [WebDriver
protocol] to communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox.  It
translates calls into the [Marionette remote protocol] by acting
as a proxy between the local- and remote ends.

[WebDriver protocol]: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#protocol
[Marionette remote protocol]: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/marionette/
