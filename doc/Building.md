# Building geckodriver

geckodriver is written in [Rust], a systems programming language
from Mozilla.  Crucially, it relies on the [webdriver crate] to
provide the HTTPD and do most of the heavy lifting of marshalling
the WebDriver protocol. geckodriver translates WebDriver [commands],
[responses], and [errors] to the [Marionette protocol], and acts
as a proxy between [WebDriver] and [Marionette].

To build geckodriver:

```shell
% ./mach build testing/geckodriver
```

If you use artifact builds you may build geckodriver using cargo,
since mach in this case does not have a compile environment:

```shell
% cd testing/geckodriver
% cargo build
…
Compiling geckodriver v0.21.0 (file:///code/gecko/testing/geckodriver)
…
Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 7.83s
```

Because all Rust code in central shares the same cargo workspace,
the binary will be put in the `$(topsrcdir)/target` directory.

You can run your freshly built geckodriver this way:

```shell
% ./mach geckodriver -- --other --flags
```

See [Testing](Testing.md) for how to run tests.
