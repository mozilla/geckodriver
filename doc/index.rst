===========

geckodriver is a proxy for using W3C WebDriver-compatible clients
to interact with Gecko-based browsers.

This program provides the HTTP API described by the WebDriver
protocol to communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox.
It translates calls into the Marionette remote protocol by acting
as a proxy between the local- and remote ends.
