Change log
==========

All notable changes to this program is documented in this file.


0.24.0 [917474f3473e] (2018-01-28)
------------------------------------

### Added

- Introduces `strictFileInteractability` capability

  The new capabilitiy indicates if strict interactability checks
  should be applied to `<input type=file>` elements.  As strict
  interactability checks are off by default, there is a change
  in behaviour when using [Element Send Keys] with hidden file
  upload controls.

- Added new endpoint `GET /session/{session id}/moz/screenshot/full`
  for taking full document screenshots, thanks to Greg Fraley.

- Added new `--marionette-host <HOSTNAME>` flag for binding to a
  particular interface/IP layer on the system.

- Added new endpoint `POST /session/{session_id}/window/new`
  for the [New Window] command to create a new top-level browsing
  context, which can be either a window or a tab.

- When using the preference `devtools.console.stdout.content` set to
  `true` logging of console API calls like `info()`, `warn()`, and
  `error()` can be routed to stdout.

- geckodriver now sets the `app.update.disabledForTesting` preference
  to prevent Firefox >= 65 from automatically updating whilst under
  automation.

### Removed

- Turned off builds for arm7hf, which will no longer be released but
  can still be built from the source.

### Changed

- Allow file uploads to hidden `<input type=file>` elements

  Through a series of changes to the WebDriver specification,
  geckodriver is now aligned with chromedriver’s behaviour that
  allows interaction with hidden `<input type=file>` elements.

  This allows WebDriver to be used with various popular web
  frameworks that—through indirection—hides the file upload control
  and invokes it through other means.

- Allow use of an indefinite script timeout for the [Set Timeouts]
  command, thanks to reimu.

### Fixed

- Corrected `Content-Type` of response header to `utf-8` to fix
  an HTTP/1.1 compatibility bug.

- Relaxed the deserialization of timeouts parameters to allow unknown
  fields for the [Set Timeouts] command.

- Fixed a regression in the [Take Element Screenshot] to not screenshot
  the viewport, but the requested element.


0.23.0 (2018-10-03)
-------------------

This release contains a number of fixes for regressions introduced
in 0.22.0, where we shipped a significant refactoring to the way
geckodriver internally dealt with JSON serialisation.

### Removed

- The POST `/session/{session id}/element/{element id}/tap` endpoint
  was removed, thanks to Kerem Kat.

### Changed

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to 0.38.0.

### Fixed

- `desiredCapabilities` and `requiredCapabilities` are again
  recognised on session creation

  A regression in 0.22.0 caused geckodriver to recognise `desired`
  and `required` instead of the correct `desiredCapabilities`
  and `requiredCapabilities`.  This will have caused significant
  problems for users who relied on this legacy Selenium-style
  session creation pattern.

  Do however note that support for Selenium-styled new session
  requests is temporary and that this will be removed sometime
  before the 1.0 release.

- `duration` field made optional on pause actions

  A regression in 0.22.0 caused the pause action primitive to
  require a `duration` field.  This has now been fixed so that
  pauses in action chains can be achieved with the default duration.

- Log level formatted to expected Marionette input

  A regression in 0.22.0 caused the log level to be improperly
  formatted when using Firefox pre-releases.  This is now fixed so
  that the requested log level is correctly interpreted by Marionette.

- `temporary` field on addon installation made optional

  A regression in 0.22.0 caused the `temporary` field for POST
  `/session/{session id}/moz/addon/install` to be mandatory.  This has
  now been fixed so that an addon is installed permanently by default.

- SHA1s in version information uses limited number of characters

  The SHA1 used in `--version` when building geckodriver from a
  git repository is now limited to 12 characters, as it is when
  building from an hg checkout.  This ensures reproducible builds.


0.22.0 (2018-09-15)
-------------------

This release marks an important milestone on the path towards
a stable release of geckodriver.  Large portions of geckodriver
and the [webdriver] library it is based on has been refactored to
accommodate using [serde] for JSON serialization.

We have also made great strides to improving [WebDriver conformance],
to the extent that geckodriver is now _almost_ entirely conforming
to the standard.

### Added

- Support for WebDriver web element-, web frame-, and web window
  identifiers from Firefox.

- Added support for the non-configurable `setWindowRect` capability
  from WebDriver.

  This capability informs whether the attached browser supports
  manipulating the window dimensions and position.

- A new extension capability `moz:geckodriverVersion` is returned
  upon session creation.

### Changed

- All JSON serialization and deserialisation has moved from
  rustc_serialize to [serde].

- The HTTP status codes used for [script timeout] and [timeout]
  errors has changed from Request Timeout (408) to Internal Server
  Error (500) in order to not break HTTP/1.1 `Keep-Alive` support,
  as HTTP clients interpret the old status code to mean they should
  duplicate the request.

- The HTTP/1.1 `Keep-Alive` timeout for persistent connections  has
  been increased to 90 seconds.

- An [invalid session ID] error is now returned when there is no
  active session.

- An [invalid argument] error is now returned when [Add Cookie]
  is given invalid parameters.

- The handshake when geckodriver connects to Marionette has been
  hardened by killing the Firefox process if it fails.

- The handshake read timeout has been reduced to 10 seconds instead
  of waiting forever.

- The HTTP server geckodriver uses, [hyper], has been upgraded to
  version 0.12, thanks to [Bastien Orivel].

- geckodriver version number is no longer logged on startup, as
  the log level is not configured until a session is created.

  The version number is available through `--version`, and now
  also through a new `moz:geckodriverVersion` field in the matched
  capabilities.

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to 0.37.0.

### Fixed

- Parsing [timeout object] values has been made WebDriver conforming,
  by allowing floats as input.

- Implicit downloads of OpenH264 and Widevine plugins has been disabled.

- The commit hash and date displayed when invoking `--version`
  is now well-formatted when built from an hg repository, thanks to
  [Jeremy Lempereur].

- Many documentation improvements, now published on
  https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/testing/geckodriver/geckodriver/.


0.21.0 (2018-06-15)
-------------------

Note that with this release of geckodriver the minimum recommended
Firefox and Selenium versions have changed:

  - Firefox 57 (and greater)
  - Selenium 3.11 (and greater)

### Added

- Support for the chrome element identifier from Firefox.

- The `unhandledPromptBehavior` capability now accepts `accept and
  notify`, `dismiss and notify`, and `ignore` options.

  Note that the unhandled prompt handler is not fully supported in
  Firefox at the time of writing.

### Changed

- Firefox will now be started with the `-foreground` and `-no-remote`
  flags if they have not already been specified by the user in
  `moz:firefoxOptions`.

  `-foreground` will ensure the application window gets focus when
  Firefox is started, and `-no-remote` will prevent remote commands
  to this instance of Firefox and also ensure we always start a new
  instance.

- WebDriver commands that do not have a return value now correctly
  return `{value: null}` instead of an empty dictionary.

- The HTTP server now accepts `Keep-Alive` connections.

- Firefox remote protocol command mappings updated.

  All Marionette commands changed to make use of the `WebDriver:`
  prefixes introduced with Firefox 56.

- Overhaul of Firefox preferences.

  Already deprecated preferences in Firefox versions earlier than
  57 got removed.

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to 0.36.0.

### Fixed

- Force use of IPv4 network stack.

  On certain system configurations, where `localhost` resolves to
  an IPv6 address, geckodriver would attempt to connect to Firefox
  on the wrong IP stack, causing the connection attempt to time out
  after 60 seconds.  We now ensure that geckodriver uses IPv4
  consistently to both connect to Firefox and for allocating a free
  port.

- geckodriver failed to locate the correct Firefox binary if it was
  found under a _firefox_ or _firefox-bin_ directory, depending on
  the system, because it thought the parent directory was the
  executable.

- On Unix systems (macOS, Linux), geckodriver falsely reported
  non-executable files as valid binaries.

- When stdout and stderr is redirected by geckodriver, a bug prevented
  the redirections from taking effect.


0.20.1 (2018-04-06)
-------------------

### Fixed

- Avoid attempting to kill Firefox process that has stopped.

  With the change to allow Firefox enough time to shut down in
  0.20.0, geckodriver started unconditionally killing the process
  to reap its exit status.  This caused geckodriver to inaccurately
  report a successful Firefox shutdown as a failure.

  The regression should not have caused any functional problems, but
  the termination cause and the exit status are now reported correctly.


0.20.0 (2018-03-08)
-------------------

### Added

- New `--jsdebugger` flag to open the [Browser Toolbox] when Firefox
  launches.  This is useful for debugging Marionette internals.

- Introduced the temporary, boolean capability
  `moz:useNonSpecCompliantPointerOrigin` to disable the WebDriver
  conforming behavior of calculating the Pointer Origin.

### Changed

- HTTP status code for the [`StaleElementReference`] error changed
  from 400 (Bad Request) to 404 (Not Found).

- Backtraces from geckodriver no longer substitute for missing
  Marionette stacktraces.

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to 0.35.0.

### Fixed

- The Firefox process is now given ample time to shut down, allowing
  enough time for the Firefox shutdown hang monitor to kick in.

  Firefox has an integrated background monitor that observes
  long-running threads during shutdown.  These threads will be
  killed after 63 seconds in the event of a hang.  To allow Firefox
  to shut down these threads on its own, geckodriver has to wait
  that time and some additional seconds.

- Grapheme clusters are now accepted as input for keyboard input
  to actions.

  Input to the `value` field of the `keyDown` and `keyUp` action
  primitives used to only accept single characters, which means
  geckodriver would error when a valid grapheme cluster was sent in,
  for example with the tamil nadu character U+0BA8 U+0BBF.

  Thanks to Greg Fraley for fixing this bug.

- Improved error messages for malformed capability values.


0.19.1 (2017-10-30)
-------------------

### Changed

- Search suggestions in the location bar turned off as not to
  trigger network connections

- Block addons incompatible with E10s

### Fixed

- Marionette stacktraces are now correctly propagated

- Some error messages have been clarified

### Removed

- Removed obsolete `socksUsername` and `socksPassword` proxy
  configuration keys because neither were picked up or recognised


0.19.0 (2017-09-16)
-------------------

Note that with geckodriver 0.19.0 the following versions are recommended:
- Firefox 55.0 (and greater)
- Selenium 3.5 (and greater)

### Added

- Added endpoint:
  - POST `/session/{session id}/window/minimize` for the [Minimize Window]
    command

- Added preference `extensions.shield-recipe-client.api_url` to disable
  shield studies which could unexpectedly change the behavior of Firefox

- Introduced the temporary, boolean capability `moz:webdriverClick` to
  enable the WebDriver conforming behavior of the [Element Click] command

- Added crashreporter environment variables to better control the browser
  in case of crashes

- Added preference `dom.file.createInChild` set to true to allow file
  object creation in content processes

### Changed

- Log all used application arguments and not only `-marionette`

- Early abort connection attempts to Marionette if the Firefox process
  closed unexpectetly

- Removed deprecated `socksProxyVersion` in favor of `socksVersion`

- Removed `ftpProxyPort`, `httpProxyPort`, `sslProxyPort`, and
  `socksProxyPort` because _ports_ have to be set for `ftpProxy`,
  `httpProxy`, `sslProxy`, and `socksProxy` using ":<PORT>"

- The `proxyType` `noproxy` has been replaced with `direct` in accordance
  with recent WebDriver specification changes

- The [`WindowRectParameters`] have been updated to return signed 32-bit
  integers in accordance with the CSS and WebDriver specifications, and
  to be more liberal with the input types

- Mapped the [`FullscreenWindow`] to the correct Marionette command

- To make sure no browser process is left behind when the [`NewSession`]
  fails, the process is closed immediately now

- `/moz/addon/install` command accepts an `addon` parameter, in lieu of
  `path`, containing an addon as a Base64 string (fixed by [Jason Juang])

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to version 0.31.0

- [mozrunner crate] upgraded to version 0.5.0

### Removed

- Removed the following obsolete preferences for Firefox:
  - `browser.safebrowsing.enabled`
  - `browser.safebrowsing.forbiddenURIs.enabled`
  - `marionette.defaultPrefs.port`
  - `marionette.logging`


0.18.0 (2017-07-10)
-------------------

### Changed

- [`RectResponse`] permits returning floats for `width` and `height`
  fields

- New type [`CookieResponse`] for the [`GetNamedCookie`] command returns
  a single cookie, as opposed to an array of a single cookie

- To pick up a prepared profile from the filesystem, it is now possible
  to pass `["-profile", "/path/to/profile"]` in the `args` array on
  `moz:firefoxOptions`

- geckodriver now recommends Firefox 53 and greater

- Version information (`--version`) contains the hash from from the
  commit used to build geckodriver

- geckodriver version logged on startup

- [webdriver crate] upgraded to version 0.27.0

- [mozrunner crate] upgraded to version 0.4.1

### Fixed

- The [`SetTimeouts`] command maps to the Marionette `setTimeouts`
  command, which makes geckodriver compatible with Firefox 56 and greater

- Linux x86 (i686-unknown-linux-musl) builds are fixed


0.17.0 (2017-06-09)
-------------------

### Added

- Added endpoints:
  - POST `/session/{session id}/window/fullscreen` to invoke the window
    manager-specific `full screen` operation
  - POST `/session/{session id}/moz/addon/install` to install an extension
    (Gecko only)
  - POST `/session/{session id}/moz/addon/uninstall` to uninstall an
    extension (Gecko only)

### Changed

- Increasing the length of the `network.http.phishy-userpass-length`
  preference will cause Firefox to not prompt when navigating to a
  website with a username or password in the URL

- Library dependencies upgraded to mozrunner 0.4 and mozprofile 0.3
  to allow overriding of preferences via capabilities if those have been
  already set in the profile

- Library dependencies upgraded to mozversion 0.1.2 to only use the
  normalized path of the Firefox binary for version checks but not to
  actually start the browser, which broke several components in Firefox
  on Windows

### Fixed

- The [SetWindowRect] command now returns the [WindowRectResponse]
  when it is done

- Use ASCII versions of array symbols to properly display them in the
  Windows command prompt

- Use [`SessionNotCreated`] error instead of [`UnknownError`] if there
  is no current session


0.16.1 (2017-04-26)
-------------------

### Fixed

- Read Firefox version number from stdout when failing
  to look for the application .ini file (fixes [Selenium
  #3884](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/3884))

- Session is now ended when closing the last Firefox window (fixes
  [#613](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/613))


0.16.0 (2017-04-21)
-------------------

Note that geckodriver v0.16.0 is only compatible with Selenium 3.4
and greater.

### Added

- Support for WebDriver-conforming [New Session] negotiation, with
  `desiredCapabilities`/`requiredCapabilities` negotiation as fallback

- Added two new endpoints:
  - GET `/session/{session id}/window/rect` for [Get Window Rect]
  - POST `/session/{session id}/window/rect` for [Set Window Rect]

- Align errors with the [WebDriver errors]:
  - Introduces new errors [`ElementClickIntercepted`],
  [`ElementNotInteractable`], [`InvalidCoordinates`], [`NoSuchCookie`],
  [`UnableToCaptureScreen`], and [`UnknownCommand`]
  - Removes `ElementNotVisible` and `InvalidElementCoordinates` errors

### Removed

- Removed following list of unused endpoints:
  - GET `/session/{session id}/alert_text`
  - POST `/session/{session id}/alert_text`
  - POST `/session/{session id}/accept_alert`
  - POST `/session/{session id}/dismiss_alert`
  - GET `/session/{session id}/window_handle`
  - DELETE `/session/{session id}/window_handle`
  - POST `/session/{session id}/execute_async`
  - POST `/session/{session id}/execute`

### Changed

- [`SendKeysParameters`], which is used for the [Element Send Keys] and
  [Send Alert Text] commands, has been updated to take a string `text`
  field

- [`CookieResponse`] and [`CloseWindowResponse`] fixed to be properly
  wrapped in a `value` field, like other responses

- Allow negative numbers for `x` and `y` fields in `pointerMove` action

- Disable Flash and the plugin container in Firefox by
  default, which should help mitigate the “Plugin Container
  for Firefox has stopped wroking” problems [many users were
  reporting](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/225) when
  deleting a session

- Preferences passed in a profile now take precedence over
  set of default preferences defined by geckodriver (fixed by
  [Marc Fisher](https://github.com/DrMarcII))
  - The exceptions are the `marionette.port` and `marionette.log.level`
    preferences and their fallbacks, which are set unconditionally and
    cannot be overriden

- Remove default preference that disables unsafe CPOW checks

- WebDriver library updated to 0.25.2

### Fixed

- Fix for the “corrupt deflate stream” exception that
  sometimes occured when trying to write an empty profile by
  [@kirhgoph](https://github.com/kirhgoph)

- i686-unknown-linux-musl (Linux 32-bit) build fixed

- Log messages from other Rust modules are now ignored

- Improved log messages to the HTTPD


0.15.0 (2017-03-08)
-------------------

### Added

- Added routing and parsing for the [Get Timeouts] command

### Changed

- All HTTP responses are now wrapped in `{value: …}` objects per the
  WebDriver specification; this may likely require you to update your
  client library

- Pointer move action’s `element` key changed to `origin`, which
  lets pointer actions originate within the context of the viewport,
  the pointer’s current position, or from an element

- Now uses about:blank as the new tab document; this was previously
  disabled due to [bug 1333736](https://bugzil.la/1333736) in Marionette

- WebDriver libary updated to 0.23.0

### Fixed

- Aligned the data structure accepted by the [Set Timeouts] command with
  the WebDriver specification


0.14.0 (2017-01-31)
-------------------

### Changed

- Firefox process is now terminated and session ended when the last

-------------------

### Changed

- When navigating to a document with an insecure- or otherwise invalid
  TLS certificate, an [insecure certificate] error will be returned

- On macOS, deducing Firefox’ location on the system will look for
  _firefox-bin_ on the system path (`PATH` environmental variable) before
  looking in the applications folder

- Window position coordinates are allowed to be negative numbers, to
  cater for maximised window positioning on Windows

- WebDriver library updated to version 0.18.0

### Fixed

- Check for single-character key codes in action sequences now counts
  characters instead of bytes


0.12.0 (2017-01-03)
-------------------

### Added

- Added [Take Element Screenshot] command

- Added new [Status] command

- Added routing for the [Get Timeouts] command, but it is not yet
  implemented in Marionette, and will return an _unsupported operation_
  error until it is

- Implemented routing for [new actions API](Actions), but it too is not
  yet fully implemented in Marionette

### Changed

- [Synced Firefox
  preferences](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/commit/2bfdc3ec8151c427a6a75a6ba3ad203459540495)
  with those used in Mozilla automation

- Default log level for debug builds of Firefox, which used to be `DEBUG`,
  changed to `INFO`-level

- WebDriver library dependency upgraded to 0.17.1

- Using _session not created_ error when failing to start session

- geckodriver will exit with exit code 69 to indicate that the port
  is unavailable

### Fixed

  inconsistent output when failing to bind to port

- Clarified in README that geckodriver is not supported on Windows XP

- Added documentation of supported capabilities to [README]

- Included capabilities example in the [README]


0.11.1 (2016-10-10)
-------------------

### Fixed

- Version number in binary now reflects the release version


0.11.0 (2016-10-10)
-------------------

### Added

- Introduced continous integration builds for Linux- and Windows 32-bit
  binaries

- Added commands for setting- and getting the window position

- Added new extension commands for finding an element’s anonymous
  children and querying its attributes; accessible through the
  `/session/{sessionId}/moz/xbl/{elementId}/anonymous_children`
  to return all anonymous children and
  `/session/{sessionId}/moz/xbl/{elementId}/anonymous_by_attribute` to
  return an anonymous element by a name and attribute query

- Introduced a `moz:firefoxOptions` capability to customise a Firefox
  session:

  - The `binary`, `args`, and `profile` entries on this dictionary
    is equivalent to the old `firefox_binary`, `firefox_args`, and
    `firefox_profile` capabilities, which have now all been removed

  - The `log` capability takes a dictionary such as `{log: "trace"}`
    to enable trace level verbosity in Gecko

  - The `prefs` capability lets you define Firefox preferences through
    capabilities

- Re-introduced the `--webdriver-port` argument as a hidden alias to
  `--port`

### Changed

- `firefox_binary`, `firefox_args`, and `firefox_profile` capabilities
  removed in favour of the `moz:firefoxOptions` dictionary detailed above

  Firefox default multiprocessing settings (override using preferences)

- Disable pop-up blocker in the default profile by @juangj

- Changed Rust compiler version to 1.12 (beta)
  temporarily because of [trouble linking Musl
  binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/34978)

- Replaced _env_logger_ logging facility with the _slog_ package,
  causing the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to no longer have any affect

- Updated the WebDriver Rust library to version 0.15

### Fixed

- Corrected link to repository in Cargo metadata

- Verbosity shorthand flag `-v[v]` now works again, following the
  replacement of the argument parsing library in the previous release

- When the HTTPD fails to start, errors are propagated to the user

- Disabled the additional welcome URL
  (`startup.homepage_welcome_url.additional`) so that officially branded
  Firefox builds do not start with two open tabs in fresh profiles

- Disabled homepage override URL redirection on milestone upgrades,
  which means a tab with an upgrade notice is not displayed when launching
  a new Firefox version


0.10.0 (2016-08-02)
-------------------

### Changed

- Use multi-process Firefox (e10s) by default, added flag `--no-e10s`
